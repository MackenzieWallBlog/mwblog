#Leaky Pipe UX Philosphy

There is a toxic attitude in development that is not helpful or productive in any circumstance: the urge to blame the user.

When someone uses your application, and they can't find the right link, aren't navigating the way you thought they would: it is never the user's fault.

A leaky pipe is never the water's fault. You fix the pipe, not the water. Same for software.

Every problem can be solved by design. And if the solution is an informative modal, I would like to ask you what you thought of the last informative modal you closed as quickly as humanly possible.
It is unfortunate, but advertisements have already taught everyone to close popups without much thought. 

This is actually good news, because getting better users is usually not an easy task. :)

One of the best talks I ever heard at a conference was given by Eric Meyer. He shared the heartbreaking tale of being at his wit's end, trying to find the phone number on a hospital website.
Sometimes, people do not have the mental resources to figure out a complex system. That doesn't make them dumb- it makes them human.
When they have trouble getting what they want, it isn't a problem with them. It is a problem with the design.

This is a design princible, but I am putting it under "code" because code is inseperable from design. If there is no designer, the coder did the designing. 
I have found knowing how everything works, top to bottom, helps solve problems at the source, instead of slapping a band-aid on it.
