# UV Curing Chamber

After recently purchasing an Anycubic Photon, I thought I would share by little UV curing setup. I had some good luck finding parts that seemed to fit together.

Here is is with the light off, a bit easier to see.

This is all it took:

A nail drying UV lamp (the trifold design)

A similar trifold mirror (this would be the easiest to do yourself if you already have some small mirrors around.)

And a small display turntable that is SOLAR powered. From the UV light. Truly using all of the animal on this one.

The UV nail lamp and the mirror tend to go in and out of stock and you may need to source similar parts. The special sauce is definitely the little Turntable though! If you can find that, you can make the rest work easy.

The only part not listed here is the 3/4 inch thick Styrofoam I used to lift up the UV lamp a bit. I think thinking of printing something to take the place of it, but it works for now.

Cheers! :)
